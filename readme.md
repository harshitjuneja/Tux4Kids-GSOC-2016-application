> - University : [The NorthCap University](http://ncuindia.edu), Haryana, India
> 
> - Current Enrolment : Senior Year (2013-2017), Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering
> - Short bio :
> I am fluent in JavaScript, C and C++, have implemented  web applications. I am very familiar with the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) game engine. My involvement with open source started 2 months back with the same organization wherein I developed a memory game for Tux4Me.

Coding Skills
-------------

> - My machine is dual booted with ubuntu 14.04.4 and windows 7 Ultimate. 
>   H/W Specifications:  intel core i5(2nd gen)@2.5GhZ, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD.
>   
> - I use Brackets (FOSS) and Sublime text (because it's free forever) and vim or Emacs often.
> 
> -  I was introduced to computer programming just after joining my graduation school, with the C language, until then I had just read in books, that computers are unintelligent machines  and need to be fed even minute level of detail. With memory allocation and pointers in **C**, I experienced this first handedly. Thereafter I started learning C++ as a part of the course and it's ability to model nearly anything in the real world with the object-oriented approach fascinated me the most. With some projects, **C++** became intuitive and I started having fun writing code.
>  

> - Version Control System : **Git** & **Github**.
> 
> - Desired knowledge for TuxMindMath:
> >1. Game Engine : Phaser
> >2. Scripting Language : JavaScript
> >3. Design : CSS, Bootstrap, Material Design(beginner).
>>4. Content : Vedic mathematics tricks (familiar)

Project(Tux Mind Math)
-------------

>- **Project Goals :**
> 1.  Enable kids to calculate faster (Step-wise tricks). 
> 2.  Tell them how quick they actually are (Cumulative index).
> 3. Make learning fun and motivating (Scoring and Level based games).

----------


> 
>- **Why Tux Mind Math ?** 
>1. I will get to try more animations and effects and leverage the full potential of Phaser along with HTML5.
>2. I believe making easily understandable and entertaining games is the perfect way to supplement boring regular classwork. When it's a game we tend to learn quickly. 

----------


>- **Why me ?**
>
>1. Already familiar with the all the pre-requisites for Tux Mind Math development(Phaser, JavaScript and web design including HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap).
>2. Already familiar with the code base and community code standards, so time saved here. Yes! let's get working from day one.
>3. Willing to dedicate the required 40 hours/week during the whole summer and flexibly after my classes begin.
>4.  Always willing to learn stuff that's required or helpful or both.


----------


 
>- **Time during and after GSOC :**
>
>  I plan on devoting my entire summer to this. I won't have any other kind of job, so I will be able to work a standard 40 hour week for the coding period. Also, my classes will end well before the coding period begins and will not start up again until well after the pencils down date, so I will be totally free for the whole period.
>  

>  One of my goals will be to add more number of tricks after my summer break. Time to the project will vary from 10-15 hours a week, but I hope to make sure new tricks keep coming in.

----------
> 
>- **Deliverables** 
>####*Before the official working period*:
>  Although I will be able to do little until classes end, I would have no problems starting with the project "early". I have already been following the tux4kids discussion group for some time and have looked at some of the code base, and this will be a great time for me to even better familiarize myself with the community. I could easily start coding the actual project during this period. This would allow me to potentially finish more by the end of the summer. 

>I plan to have games divided under 4 categories : addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each category will have some specific tricks that work on a special set of numbers.
 
> example :     Multiplication by 8  

>               QUESTION : 522*8=?
>
>------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>        STEP 1:            as 8 = 10 - 2
>        STEP 2:            522 * 10 = 5220
>        STEP 3:            522 * 2= 1044
>        STEP 4:      Hence 522 * 8 = (522 * 10) - (522 * 2)
>                                = 4176
>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>                                
> This trick is only for multiplication with  8. Likewise I plan to add tricks under different categories after discussion with my mentor. The number and kind of tricks added for GSOC this summer for each category shall be finalized before the actual coding period.
